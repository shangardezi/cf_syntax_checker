# Syntax Checker: Unzips and Syntax checks HTML files.

## Why?
Student submissions are often in the form of a zip file containing HTML, CSS and JS files. More often than not, there are sytnax
or styling issues, which can be tedious to inspect, list and feedback to the student. I feel time is better spent discussing solutions
and answering questions rather than checking code for syntax errors students.
This simple Ruby script unzips, inspects HTML files for syntax issues and outputs the filename alongside the errors.
